## Quick start guide

### Installation

To use the `problexity` package, it will be absolutely useful to install it. Fortunately, it is available in the *PyPI* repository, so you may install it using `pip`:

```shell
pip3 install -U problexity
```

You can also install the module cloned from Github using the setup.py file if you have a strange, but perhaps legitimate need:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/w4k2/problexity.git
cd problexity
make install
```
